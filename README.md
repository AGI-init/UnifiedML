# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

> The unified model to top unified models! UnifiedML is the best of all worlds: accelerated, accessible and easy, state of the art, and general, to meet the need of every domain and then some. By itself, it's a great learner for bootstrapping ML projects, across RL, computer vision, generative modeling, and robotics. Because of its intuitive code, incredible API, and creatorâ€™s passion, this library is the easiest way to reproduce individual ML works. But going further, with the development of a generalism API, it has the potential to be AGI, a grand unifying theory, and much more than a library.
