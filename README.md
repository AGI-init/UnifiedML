# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

[See full documentation here.](https://agi-init.github.io/UnifiedML)

> This work is an effort to create the best of all worlds in ML: accelerated, accessible and easy, state of the art, and general, to meet every ML need and then some. The purpose of a generalist agent is reflected by the expression "greater than the sum of parts". For each task in a pool of learnable tasks, a singular agent may learn to better generalize not just on each one individually[1^], but on new tasks[^2] due to the generalization of transferable knowledge. In the future, this library will be the easiest way to reproduce ML works. I ask for you to [sponsor]() this work and help provide the necessary compute resources to realize the full potential of this library. UnifiedML is much more than a library.

# Contributing

### Sponsorships & support

This library is built by a single individual from low-income means on almost no funding. [Please support financially by sponsoring if you can]()  and if you have access to compute and resources that you would be willing to contribute, please reach out to me at [agi.init@gmail.com]().

### Push-requests

This library is a work of passion and dedication. The standards for accepted push requests are high, but if you have a push that you would like to make or a contribution that you would like to propose, you may [make a request]() and/or leave a note to me either in [issues]() or by email at [agi.init@gmail.com]().

Thank you.
