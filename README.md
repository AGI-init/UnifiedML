# Welcome

See our library [Tributaries](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries) for mass-deploying UnifiedML apps on remote servers.

Check out [minihydra / leviathan](https://github.com/Cave-Dwellers-Tree-People/minihydra) for how we handle sys args & hyperparams.

## Install

```console
pip install UnifiedML
```

UnifiedML is a toolbox & engine for defining ML tasks and training them individually, or together in a single general intelligence.

[See full documentation here.](https://agi-init.github.io/UnifiedML)

> This work is an effort to create the best of all worlds in ML: accelerated, accessible and easy, state of the art, and general, to meet every ML need and then some. The purpose of a generalist agent is reflected by the expression "greater than the sum of parts". For each task in a pool of learnable tasks, a singular agent may learn to better generalize not just on each one individually, but on new tasks due to the generalization of transferable knowledge. In the future, this library will be the easiest way to reproduce ML works. I ask for you to [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AGI-init) this work and help provide the necessary compute and resources to realize the full potential of this library. UnifiedML is much more than a library.
